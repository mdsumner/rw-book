# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a Quarto book about geospatial data structures in R and Python (and
other languages).

The book started with the idea that there is a fundamental value in the concept
of a *regular grid* and that, sadly, this does not have a natural low-entropy
expression in some modern scientific array formats, and sadder again, that this
has affected a very influential and powerful software package.
